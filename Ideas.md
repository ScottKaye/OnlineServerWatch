# Ideas
- Server boxes look more like computers/routers
- Blink a light somewhere whenever a message is received
- Names are linked to steam profiles in the killfeed and chat
- Limit width of each column, long names easily push the width beyond what it should be
- Player connection timer
- Player score
- Users can choose to highlight/trigger notifications for certain words that appear in any chat feed
  - Replace the hardcoded !admin and !report triggers
  - Save to localStorage
- Automatic chat URL linking
